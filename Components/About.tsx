"Communicating in life is stressful, but when a screen is in between you and a person all that anxiety goes away.
Making friends your age is tough too, as you have to initiate the conversation and overcome the fear of judgment.
Online there are some alternatives where you can meet strangers online, but it is unsafe and you can see some pretty 
disturbing things. Thus, we created the Scholars' Circle, the first website you can use in order to meet strangers 
your age that live nearby. Scholars' Circle was made to be used to make online friends that you know are not creepy old men,
which could go on to become your permanent real life friends. Be safe, use Scholars' Circle."
