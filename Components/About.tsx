     Communicating in life is stressful, but when a screen is in between you and a person all that anxiety goes away.
     Making friends your age is tough too, as you have to initiate the conversation and overcome the fear of judgment.
     Scholars' Circle was made to be used to make online friends that you know are not creepy. Which could go on to become your permanent real life friends.
